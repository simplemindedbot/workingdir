# Manual Report Creation: Storage, Notification, Expiration, and UI Access

## Notes

### Report Storage & Access
- Generated manual reports will be saved to a **user-accessible location** (e.g., within the CBCI admin console).
- Reports should be scoped to the requesting user and not visible to others.
- Files should use a consistent naming format:  
  `CBCI_ManualReport_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.csv`

### User Notification
- After successful report generation:
  - An **email notification** is sent to the user.
  - A **CBCI in-app notification** (e.g., within a “My Reports” section or banner) is optionally displayed.

### Report Lifecycle
- Reports expire **24 hours after creation** if not downloaded.
- Reports are deleted **immediately upon successful download**.
- Expired reports are removed automatically and marked as such in the UI.

### UI Component: “My Reports”
- A new UI screen or section called **“My Reports”** is introduced.
- Users can view reports they generated manually.
- Each report entry includes:
  - Report Name
  - Status: In Progress, Available, or Expired
  - Date/Time requested
  - Download link (if Available)
- Optional enhancements: sorting/filtering by request date or status.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature: Manual Report Generation Workflow

**Scenario: Report is saved to user-accessible location**  
**Given** a CBCI admin has submitted a request to generate a manual report  
**When** the report generation is complete  
**Then** the report should be saved in a user-accessible location  
**And** the report should be associated with the requesting user only  
**And** the file should follow the naming convention: `CBCI_ManualReport_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.csv`

---

**Scenario: User is notified via email and CBCI interface**  
**Given** a manual report has been successfully generated  
**Then** the system should send an email to the requesting user  
**And** the email should include a secure link or instructions to access the report  
**And** a notification should appear in the CBCI console under “My Reports”

---

**Scenario: Report is deleted after download or expiration**  
**Given** a manual report has been generated and is available to download  
**When** the user downloads the report  
**Then** the report should be deleted from the system  
**Or When** the report is more than 24 hours old  
**Then** the system should automatically delete the report and mark it as expired in the UI

---

**Scenario: User views available reports**  
**Given** I am a CBCI admin user  
**When** I navigate to the “My Reports” section  
**Then** I should see a list of my manually created reports  
**And** each report should show:
- Report Name
- Status (e.g., In Progress, Available, Expired)
- Date/Time of Request  
**And** if a report is available, I should be able to download it
