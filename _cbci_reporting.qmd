# CBCI Reporting Feature â€“ User Stories

This document contains the initial set of prioritized user stories for structured report generation from the CBCI system. These stories focus on manual export, scheduled reporting, data dictionary management, optional model output, and downstream publishing.

---

## User Story 1: On-Demand Report Export
**As** an Admin user  
**I want** to generate a report from the data dictionary fields on demand in CSV or JSON format  
**So that** I can analyze or share the data immediately without waiting for a scheduled job.

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: On-Demand Report Export

  Scenario: Admin downloads a report in CSV format
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I select "Export Report"
    And I choose "CSV" as the format
    And I provide criteria including a date range, WCIS ID, Username, and Analysis Status
    Then a CSV file is generated and downloaded with the selected fields and filters

  Scenario: Admin downloads a report in JSON format
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I select "Export Report"
    And I choose "JSON" as the format
    And I provide criteria including a date range and analysis status
    Then a JSON file is generated and downloaded

  Scenario: Admin specifies record count limit
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I configure the report to include a maximum of 5000 records
    Then the output file should contain no more than 5000 records
```

## User Story 2: Schedule Recurring Reports
**As** an Admin user  
**I want** to schedule recurring reports from the admin console  
**So that** I can automate regular delivery of structured data for analysis or archival.

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Scheduled Report Generation

  Scenario: Admin sets up a new scheduled report
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I configure a scheduled report with filters (date range, WCIS ID, Username)
    And I set the recurrence pattern (e.g., daily, weekly)
    Then the system should save the schedule and generate the report accordingly

  Scenario: Scheduled report includes up to configured record limit
    Given I have set a report limit of 10,000 records in the admin console
    When the report runs on schedule
    Then it should only include up to 10,000 records even if more match the criteria

  Scenario: Scheduled report is saved to designated location
    Given a scheduled report has run
    Then the file should be saved to a predefined directory
    And the file name should include the timestamp and identifying criteria

  Scenario: Scheduled report does not vary by requesting user
    Given a scheduled report is configured
    When it runs
    Then it should include all matching system-wide records, not user-specific data
```

## User Story 3: Include Raw Model JSON in Reports
**As** a Data Science user  
**I want** to optionally include raw JSON model output in exported reports  
**So that** I can review and compare raw model predictions alongside structured fields.

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Include Raw JSON in Export

  Scenario: Admin selects to include raw JSON in export
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I request a report and select "Include Raw Model Output"
    Then the report should contain a field with raw JSON output from the model

  Scenario: Admin chooses not to include raw model output
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I request a report and do not select "Include Raw Model Output"
    Then the report should exclude that field
```

## User Story 4: Publish Extracted Data to Downstream Systems
**As** an Admin user  
**I want** to publish structured report data to downstream systems like iHub  
**So that** data can be analyzed and visualized without manual file handling.

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Publish to Downstream Systems

  Scenario: Admin enables automatic publishing to iHub
    Given I have configured the iHub connection in the admin console
    When a report is generated (on-demand or scheduled)
    Then the data should be automatically published to the iHub endpoint

  Scenario: Publishing is disabled
    Given the iHub connection is not configured
    When a report is generated
    Then no downstream publishing should occur
```

## User Story 5: Define and Manage the Data Dictionary
**As** an Admin user  
**I want** to define and manage the data dictionary fields available for reporting  
**So that** the system can generate consistent and accurate structured reports.

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Data Dictionary Management

  Scenario: Admin views current data dictionary
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I navigate to the "Data Dictionary" section of the admin console
    Then I should see a list of all fields available for reporting
    And each field should display its name, data type, and description

  Scenario: Admin adds a new field to the dictionary
    Given I am logged in as an Admin user
    When I enter a new field name, data type, and description
    And I save the changes
    Then the field should be added to the dictionary and be available for export

  Scenario: Admin disables a field from being included in reports
    Given a field is currently enabled for reporting
    When I uncheck "Include in reports"
    Then the field should be excluded from future reports

  Scenario: Dictionary changes are versioned
    Given I make changes to the data dictionary
    Then the system should store a version history with a timestamp and user attribution
```
