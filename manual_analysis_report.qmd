Feature: Export analyses report with full metadata

  Scenario: Export a filtered set of analyses with selected metadata fields
    Given I am logged into the CBCI admin console
    And I am on the “Analysis Export” screen
    When I specify filters including:
      | Filter                         |
      | Date Range                     |
      | WCIS ID                        |
      | Optimist ID                    |
      | Requesting User ID             |
      | Analysis Status                |
      | Entity Name                    |
    And I choose whether to:
      | Option                               |
      | Include only the most recent revision|
      | Include all revisions                |
      | Include LLM raw JSON (Yes/No)        |
    And I select the output format (CSV or JSON)
    Then I should receive a downloadable file containing the selected analyses
    And each analysis record in the file should include the following fields:
      | Field Name                                                |
