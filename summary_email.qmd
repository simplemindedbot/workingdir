Subject: Follow-Up: BNKK-1844 / BNKK-1816 Data Dictionary Review

Hi all,

Thanks for the discussion earlier today. Below is a quick summary of the points I noted—please feel free to add or adjust if I’ve missed or misunderstood anything:
	•	The tech team will take a closer look at the final requirements to determine if any updates to the original point estimate are needed.
	•	A JSON version of the extract appears feasible with minimal effort.
	•	A flattened CSV version, particularly with embedded JSON blobs, may require further investigation and additional effort.
	•	The team is planning to review the data dictionary in more detail and will raise follow-up questions as needed.
	•	A phased delivery approach may be appropriate—starting with the JSON version, with CSV or other enhancements to follow.

Appreciate everyone’s input—looking forward to next steps.

Best,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like a slightly warmer or more formal tone depending on the personalities in the room, or if you’d like to draft a private note to her as a heads-up that you’re sending it.
