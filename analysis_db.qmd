Excellent. Here’s an updated and expanded user story for the admin UI export functionality, incorporating all your requirements:

⸻

User Story: Manual Export via Admin Console with Filters and Local Download

Title: Enable Filtered Manual Export of Analysis and Assertion Data via Admin Console

As an admin user
I want to extract analysis and assertion data from the admin console using meaningful filters
So that I can download only the data I need in CSV or JSON format and save it directly to my local machine for review or analysis.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Filtered export by date range
Given I am logged into the admin console
When I select "Export Dataset"
And I enter a start and end date
Then the system generates a file including only analyses created within that date range
And prompts me to download the file to my computer

Scenario: Filtered export by WCIS ID
Given I am logged into the admin console
When I select "Export Dataset"
And I enter a WCIS ID
Then the system generates a file with all analyses linked to that WCIS ID
And prompts me to download it locally

Scenario: Filtered export by Username
Given I am logged into the admin console
When I select "Export Dataset"
And I enter a Username
Then the system exports only the analyses performed by that user
And prompts me to download the file

Scenario: Filtered export by Analysis Status
Given I am logged into the admin console
When I select "Export Dataset"
And I choose an Analysis Status (e.g., Completed, Failed, Draft)
Then the system includes only records with that status
And prompts me to download the file

Scenario: Format selection and download
Given I am preparing an export
When I choose either CSV or JSON format
Then the export is generated in the selected format
And no files are saved to the server


⸻

Filter Options (UI Form Components):
	1.	Date Range:
	•	From Date → To Date (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31)
	2.	WCIS ID:
	•	Text input (exact match or contains)
	3.	Username:
	•	Dropdown or text input with typeahead
	4.	Analysis Status:
	•	Dropdown (Completed, Draft, Failed, etc.)
	5.	Format Selector:
	•	Radio buttons or dropdown (CSV, JSON)

⸻

Technical Notes:
	•	Frontend: Trigger file generation and initiate download using a secure blob URL or base64-encoded file served via browser.
	•	Backend: Filter data based on query params; return data directly in HTTP response with Content-Disposition: attachment.
	•	No server persistence: All generated files are streamed and immediately discarded server-side after download is complete.

⸻

Example File Naming Conventions:
	•	cbcimetrics_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31.csv
	•	cbcimetrics_user_jdavis_completed.json

⸻

Would you like wireframe-style mockups for this admin UI export panel?

Q1: Should multiple filters be combinable (e.g., date + WCIS ID + status), or should filters be used one at a time?
Q2: Should there be a cap on the number of rows per download (e.g., max 10,000) to avoid browser crashes?
Q3: Should users with specific roles (e.g., compliance or DS leads) have saved export presets or templates?

Great—here’s the updated version of the Manual Export via Admin Console user story and acceptance criteria, incorporating your responses:

User Story: Filtered Manual Export of Analysis and Assertion Data via Admin Console

Title: Enable Filtered and Combinable Manual Export with Download to User Device

As an admin user
I want to filter and combine multiple criteria when exporting analysis and assertion data
So that I can retrieve exactly the subset I need and save the file directly to my computer, without storing it on the server.

⸻

Filter Capabilities (Combinable Filters):
	•	Date Range: Start Date to End Date
	•	WCIS ID: Supports exact or partial match
	•	Username: Text input with typeahead
	•	Analysis Status: Select from predefined values (Completed, Failed, Draft, etc.)
	•	Export Format: CSV or JSON

⸻

Behavioral Requirements:
	•	Filters may be combined in any way (e.g., WCIS ID + date range + status)
	•	If the result set exceeds 10,000 records, the system should:
	•	Display a warning
	•	Prompt the user to refine filters or confirm download of a truncated file (with a note in the file header/footer)
	•	Download should immediately stream to the user’s local device (no intermediate server save)

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Combined export with multiple filters
Given I am logged into the admin console
When I enter a date range, WCIS ID, and select "Completed" status
And I choose JSON as the format
Then the system applies all filters
And returns only matching records
And initiates a download of the file to my computer

Scenario: Large export exceeds row limit
Given my filter criteria would return more than 10,000 records
When I initiate the export
Then the system displays a warning
And allows me to either cancel, refine filters, or proceed with a truncated export
And the export file clearly notes that it is truncated

Scenario: Format selection
Given I selected export format as CSV
Then the downloaded file is a valid CSV file containing the filtered records
And the filename includes a timestamp and key filters (e.g., `cbcimetrics_2024-01-01_to_2024-01-31_completed.csv`)


⸻

Technical Implementation Notes:
	•	File generation and filtering should happen on-demand via a single backend endpoint, with filter params sent as query/body parameters.
	•	Use streaming responses for large files to minimize browser and memory strain.
	•	Add a max row count config to the backend for future flexibility (e.g., allow up to 50,000 if needed with pagination or chunked download).
	•	Consider tracking download attempts in an audit log (future enhancement).

Would you like this story broken into technical subtasks (e.g., backend filter API, frontend UI, file streaming service)?

Q3 (from earlier): Should users be able to save export presets (e.g., “Daily WCIS Report”) for reuse, or is that out of scope for now?

Certainly. Here are detailed Gherkin-style acceptance criteria for the scheduled export of analysis and assertion data (User Story 3), including timing, format, destination handling, and error reporting.

⸻

User Story:

Title: Enable Scheduled Export of Analysis and Assertion Data in JSON and CSV Formats

⸻

Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

Feature: Scheduled export of analysis and assertion data

  Scenario: Configure a new scheduled export job
    Given I am logged into the admin console as an authorized user
    When I navigate to the "Scheduled Exports" section
    And I create a new export job with a selected format (JSON or CSV)
    And I choose a daily frequency at 02:00 AM
    Then the export job is saved
    And it appears in the list of active export jobs

  Scenario: Generate and deliver export at scheduled time
    Given a scheduled export job exists for JSON format at 02:00 AM daily
    And the system time reaches 02:00 AM
    When the export job executes
    Then the system generates the file in JSON format
    And it includes all analysis and assertion data completed since the last export
    And it is saved to the configured export destination (e.g., S3, internal file share)
    And a log entry is created indicating success

  Scenario: Scheduled export includes format and naming
    Given the export job is configured for both JSON and CSV formats
    When the job executes
    Then the system generates two files
    And their filenames include the export timestamp and format
    And both files are saved to the configured destination

  Scenario: Scheduled export fails
    Given a scheduled export job runs at its scheduled time
    And an error occurs during file generation or delivery
    Then the system logs the failure with the error reason
    And notifies the configured contact (if notifications are enabled)

  Scenario: View and edit existing scheduled jobs
    Given I am on the admin console "Scheduled Exports" section
    When I select an existing job
    Then I can modify its frequency, format, filters, or destination
    And I can save the updated job without removing past logs

  Scenario: Manually trigger a scheduled export
    Given a scheduled export job is defined
    When I click "Run Now" on the job row
    Then the export job executes immediately
    And the file is saved to the destination
    And the run is logged with a manual override flag

  Scenario: Prevent overlapping jobs
    Given two export jobs are scheduled for overlapping times
    When both jobs target the same destination path
    Then the system serializes their execution
    Or appends unique identifiers to avoid filename conflicts


⸻

Optional Enhancements for Future Stories
	•	Retention policy: Auto-delete files after N days.
	•	Time zone selection: Schedule jobs in specific time zones.
	•	Filter presets: Limit scheduled exports to specific WCIS IDs or statuses.
	•	Audit trail: View all past runs with status (Success/Failed/Skipped).

Would you like the backend logic for scheduling (e.g., CRON format support) included in implementation notes?
