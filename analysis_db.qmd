Absolutely. Here’s a refined breakdown of the three stories, aligned with your updated direction:

⸻

User Story 1: Store All Defined Analysis and Assertion Fields

Title: Store and Persist All Defined Fields for Analysis and Assertion Data

As a data engineer
I want to store all defined fields for analysis metrics and assertion data in the analytics database
So that downstream teams can access a comprehensive, structured view of CBCI outputs for reporting, diagnostics, and model evaluation.

⸻

Field Coverage:

Core Metadata
	•	Analysis Date
	•	Analysis ID
	•	Analysis Revision ID
	•	User ID, Username, Entity Name, WCIS ID, Optimist ID
	•	Analysis Status

Processing Diagnostics
	•	Processing Duration (and any subfields if broken down: extraction, prep, Tachyon call, assertion routine, total time)

Areas of Attention
	•	Metric Accuracy Rating
	•	Metric Accuracy Category
	•	Metric Accuracy Free Form Comments
	•	Materiality Rating
	•	Materiality Category
	•	Materiality Free Form Comments
	•	Areas of Attention Overall
	•	Areas of Attention Character Count

Financial Analysis
	•	Income Statement (Accuracy & Completeness ratings, categories, comments)
	•	Balance Sheet (Completeness ratings, categories, comments)
	•	Cash Flow (Completeness ratings, categories, comments)
	•	Overall Financial Analysis Comments
	•	Original Version Character Count
	•	Editable Version Character Count

Assertion Data
	•	Assertion Results (to be built)
	•	Overall Satisfaction Rating (to be built)

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Given a completed analysis and assertion process
When the system stores results to the analytics database
Then all defined fields are written to appropriate tables and columns
And any new fields introduced later can be extended without breaking existing records


⸻

User Story 2: Manual Export to JSON or CSV via Admin Console

Title: Enable Manual Export of Analysis Data via Admin Console

As an admin user
I want to manually export the analysis and assertion dataset as JSON or CSV from the admin console
So that I can inspect the data, support ad hoc requests, or perform quick reviews outside the system.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:

Given an admin user is logged into the admin console
When they select "Export Dataset"
And choose JSON or CSV format
Then the system generates and downloads the export file
And it includes all stored fields for completed records

Notes:
	•	Export should reflect the current schema, including assertion results once implemented.
	•	User should be able to select the export scope (e.g., date range, user, status) in a future enhancement.

⸻

User Story 3: Scheduled Export of Analysis Data to JSON and CSV

Title: Enable Scheduled Export of Analysis and Assertion Data in JSON and CSV Formats

As a product owner
I want to configure scheduled exports to both JSON and CSV formats from the admin console
So that downstream analytics platforms and data pipelines can consume the data on a regular basis without manual intervention.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:

Given an admin user configures a scheduled export in the admin console
When the configured time interval is reached
Then the system generates exports in both JSON and CSV formats
And saves them to the designated location (e.g., S3, SharePoint, internal file store)
And logs a status message confirming the export

Admin Console Requirements:
	•	Schedule configuration (daily, weekly, custom CRON)
	•	Format toggles (JSON, CSV, or both)
	•	Export history/status display
	•	Option to download past exports from the console

⸻

Optional Add-On (Separate Story):

Title: Configure Export Destination and Retention Policy

As a system administrator
I want to specify the destination (S3, SharePoint, etc.) and file retention duration
So that exported data is managed securely and complies with data governance standards.

⸻

Would you like me to turn this into a requirements-ready table or Jira import file?

Q1: Should the export destination (e.g., SharePoint or S3 bucket) be selectable per export job?
Q2: Is there a preferred default file naming convention or should filenames include timestamps and run IDs?
Q3: Should the system notify anyone (email/slack/etc.) on export success or failure?
