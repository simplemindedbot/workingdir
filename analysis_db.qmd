Here is a preliminary set of user stories based on the provided text. These stories are grouped by function to support export utility development, metrics field mapping, JSON file ingestion, and future enhancements.

EPIC: Enable Export and Analysis of CBCI Metrics Data

⸻

Feature 1: Develop Basic Export Utility

User Story 1.1: Export Metrics Dataset to File

As a data analyst
I want the ability to export the metrics data to a structured file format (e.g., CSV or JSON)
So that I can easily review, analyze, and monitor data quality and trends during UAT.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Given the CBCI metrics data is available in the application
When the user selects "Export Dataset"
Then a downloadable CSV or JSON file is generated
And it includes all defined metric fields
And the export is completed within 30 seconds

User Story 1.2: Schedule Regular Exports

As a product owner
I want the metrics export utility to support scheduled daily runs
So that downstream analytics pipelines can consume the latest data without manual intervention.

⸻

Feature 2: Map Metrics Fields to Database Targets

User Story 2.1: Map Analysis Metadata Fields

As a developer
I want the following fields mapped to the analytics database: Analysis Date, Analysis ID, Revision ID, User ID, Username, Entity Name, WCIS ID
So that they can be referenced in dashboards and data lineage tracking.

User Story 2.2: Map Processing Metrics

As a data engineer
I want to capture and store processing time segments (extraction, Tachyon call, assertion routine, total duration)
So that I can diagnose performance bottlenecks.

⸻

Feature 3: Include Areas of Attention and Financial Metrics

User Story 3.1: Store and Export Accuracy and Materiality Ratings

As a compliance reviewer
I want to include fields related to Accuracy, Materiality, Free Form Comments, and Overall Ratings
So that qualitative and quantitative review feedback is captured and auditable.

User Story 3.2: Capture Financial Analysis Comments and Character Counts

As a data scientist
I want the system to track both editable and original version character counts
So that I can analyze reviewer impact and verbosity across documents.

⸻

Feature 4: JSON File Consumption (Future Phase)

User Story 4.1: Ingest Transaction-Level JSON Files

As a data scientist
I want the system to ingest JSON files associated with transactions
So that I can perform deeper analysis of the raw structured output.

User Story 4.2: Link JSON Files to Analysis Records

As a developer
I want to associate each JSON file with its corresponding Analysis ID and Revision ID
So that analysts can quickly trace metric summaries to raw data.

⸻

Feature 5: Placeholder for In-App Enhancements

User Story 5.1: Add Assertion Result Field to Dataset

As a developer
I want to add support for storing and exporting assertion result data
So that completeness and accuracy checks can be traced post-generation.

User Story 5.2: Add Overall Satisfaction Rating

As a product manager
I want to capture an overall satisfaction rating from end users
So that we can assess the perceived quality and utility of the generated analysis.

⸻

Feature 6: Stakeholder Alignment and Coordination

User Story 6.1: Align with Qingling on Export Scope

As a product owner
I want to review the field list and export format with Qingling
So that the export utility delivers exactly what the DS and analytics teams need at UAT start.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Break these into subtasks for dev (e.g., export backend, frontend trigger, file storage, JSON parser).
	•	Validate final field names and types from the linked Excel file.
	•	Confirm export format (CSV vs JSON) and frequency with stakeholders.
	•	Size all work and sequence in upcoming sprints.

Would you like this output also formatted as a Jira story set with estimates, tags, or components?

Q1: Should we treat JSON ingestion as its own epic, or leave it grouped here?
Q2: Who should be the product owner for prioritization—Justin or Qingling?
Q3: Should future metrics (assertion results, satisfaction) be placeholder stories in Sprint 10 or reserved for the backlog?
