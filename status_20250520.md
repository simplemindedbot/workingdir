Daily Status Update

Date: May 20, 2025
To: Justin
From: [Your Name]

Key Activities:
	1.	Data Extracts for Analysis:
	•	Collaborated with Aaron from the Data Science team to understand the requirements for analysis-focused data extracts.
	•	Vineeta and I are actively working with Jothi to clarify field-level mappings.
	•	We plan to engage directly with the developer to ensure accurate implementation of the field mappings in the extract process.
	2.	Optimist API – Portfolio Segregation (BNKK-1553):
	•	Reached out to Jothi and Oscar for an update on the FIS-side fix for the Optimist API.
	•	Current issue: API is only returning a single portfolio per legal entity instead of all associated portfolios.
	•	Resolution of this issue is a prerequisite for completing BNKK-1553, which introduces user-level segregation of portfolios.
	3.	Knowledge Transfer and Planning:
	•	Continued ramp-up efforts with Vineeta to align her on in-flight and planned data/integration workstreams.
	•	Additional working sessions have been scheduled to ensure full context and continuity.

Let me know if you’d like any items expanded or included in a broader weekly summary as well.

Q1: Would you like this translated into a weekly roll-up format for Emily as well?
Q2: Should I include specific dates or timelines once FIS provides them regarding the API fix?
Q3: Do you want updates like this automatically converted into Jira comments or internal wiki entries going forward?
