Subject: iHub Integration Support for CBCI Project

Hi Peter,

I was referred to you by Anubhav Sharma as the appropriate contact for matters involving iHub integration with the ART system.

I’m reaching out regarding the Commercial Banking Credit Intelligence (CBCI) project. As part of this initiative, we’re developing a GenAI application that generates sections of commercial lending credit memos. We have a defined subset of data that we would like to make available in iHub and subsequently downstream to WDM for broader application use and analytics.

I’d appreciate your guidance on how best to initiate this integration—whether that’s through you directly or someone else on your team. I’m also happy to set up a call to walk through our goals and the technical context if that would be helpful.

Looking forward to your direction.

Best regards,
Scot Campbell

Q1: Would you like me to include a brief timeline or urgency for the request?
Q2: Should I add any supporting documents or context for the recipient (e.g., field mappings, data schema)?
Q3: Would it help to include Justin or another stakeholder in the initial outreach?
