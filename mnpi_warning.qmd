Certainly. Here’s the same user story, rewritten from the Product Owner’s perspective, with a focus on why the change is being prioritized and what outcome it’s expected to achieve:

User Story
Title: Add MNPI Compliance Warning to “Generate New Analysis” Tab
As the Product Owner for CBCI,
I want a clear and prominently displayed warning message added to the “Generate New Analysis” tab,
So that we reduce the risk of users inadvertently generating analyses that involve MNPI-flagged transactions and reinforce our regulatory compliance posture.

⸻

Background / Rationale:
Our users interact with transaction data that may be subject to conflicts clearance requirements under MNPI policies. Currently, there is no in-app reminder to prevent the generation of analyses involving MNPI, which creates unnecessary compliance exposure. This story addresses that gap by embedding a clear, non-dismissible warning at the point of analysis generation.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Display and Location:
	•	A persistent warning message must be shown at the top of the “Generate New Analysis” tab as soon as the user lands on the screen.
	2.	Message Text:
	•	The message should read:
Warning: CBCI must not be used to generate any analysis related to an MNPI-flagged transaction. All users are responsible for ensuring compliance with conflicts clearance policies before proceeding.
	3.	Visual Design:
	•	The message should be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the UI (e.g., red outline, bolded header, warning icon), signaling its criticality.
	4.	Universal Visibility:
	•	The warning should be displayed unconditionally to all users on the tab, regardless of transaction metadata, as we currently do not have dynamic flagging enforcement in place.
	5.	Audit Logging (if feasible):
	•	User views of this warning should be logged with a timestamp and user ID to support audit trail requirements.

⸻

Value / Outcome:
	•	Promotes responsible tool usage by end users
	•	Demonstrates proactive regulatory alignment
	•	Reduces risk of data misuse or compliance violations
