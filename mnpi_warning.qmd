Feature: MNPI Compliance Warning on Generate New Analysis Tab

  As the Product Owner for CBCI,
  I want users to see a visible warning about MNPI compliance
  So that we reduce the risk of noncompliant analysis generation

  Scenario: Display MNPI warning on Generate New Analysis tab
    Given the user navigates to the "Generate New Analysis" tab
    Then a warning message is displayed at the top of the page
    And the message reads:
      """
      Warning: CBCI must not be used to generate any analysis related to an MNPI-flagged transaction. All users are responsible for ensuring compliance with conflicts clearance policies before proceeding.
      """
    And the warning is visually styled to stand out (e.g., red border, bold font, or warning icon)

  Scenario: Warning is always shown to all users
    Given any user accesses the "Generate New Analysis" tab
    Then the MNPI warning message is shown regardless of transaction context or metadata

  Scenario: Audit logging of warning display (if implemented)
    Given the warning is displayed
    Then the system logs the display event with timestamp and user ID
