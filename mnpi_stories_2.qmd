# MNPI Access Control – Consolidated User Stories

## 1. Centralized and Maintainable MNPI Enforcement

**As** a platform engineer  
**I want** all workflows in CBCI to use a centralized service to check for MNPI-flagged entities and determine access  
**So that** the system applies consistent, maintainable logic across workflows without duplicating business rules.

This centralized service must:
- Support deal-level and loan-level MNPI flags (from WDM via RV/CRM)
- Evaluate whether the user has conflict clearance (now or in the future)
- Be modular and extensible for future policy changes

**Open Questions:**
- Q1: Should restricted analyses still appear in the user interface (with a “Restricted” label), or should they be fully hidden?
- Q2: If analyses are visible but not accessible, should metadata (e.g., title, entity name, status) still display?
- Q3: Should access decisions allow partial visibility for non-MNPI content (e.g., if only one of several loans is flagged)?

## 2. Lifecycle-Sensitive Access to MNPI-Flagged Analyses

**As** a system  
**I want** to dynamically restrict or reinstate access to in-progress and completed analyses based on changes in MNPI status and user clearance  
**So that** the system remains compliant while allowing authorized users to retain access to their work.

This means:
- Completed analyses should be temporarily restricted (not purged) when MNPI flags appear
- Users should regain access if MNPI flags are later cleared, or if they receive conflict clearance
- Analysis access state should re-evaluate on a schedule or trigger (e.g., nightly flag sync, entitlement update)

**Open Questions:**
- Q4: Who owns or governs conflict clearance status — will it be synced from a source system, manually administered, or requested by users?
- Q5: Should reinstatement of access (e.g., post-clearance) happen automatically, or should it be triggered manually?

## 3. Role-Based Access Control Across All Workflows

**As** a compliance officer  
**I want** access to MNPI-flagged analyses to be enforced consistently across all CBCI workflows  
**So that** users cannot bypass restrictions through alternate entry points such as emailed links or exports.

Covered workflows include:
- View, create, edit, finalize, rerun, and export analyses
- Analysis access via deep links, dashboards, and shared URLs
- Future integrations with model review, DS tooling, or third-party systems

**Open Questions:**
- Q6: Should downstream systems like DS/model pipelines respect the same MNPI access logic, or are they out of scope?
- Q7: If a user is actively editing an analysis when an MNPI flag is applied, should they be forcibly ejected or allowed to finish editing with a warning?

## 4. Temporary Restriction Instead of Deletion

**As** a product owner  
**I want** restricted analyses to be retained in the system but hidden or locked from unauthorized users  
**So that** users can recover access when eligibility changes, and we preserve audit and historical value.

This story formally supersedes the earlier assumption of "purge on flag."  
Access should be controlled via:
- A status marker (e.g., `restricted_due_to_mnpi`)
- A reinstatement path (flag cleared or conflict cleared)

**Open Questions:**
- Q8: If a shared analysis becomes MNPI-flagged, should we retroactively disable all existing shared access (e.g., emailed links)?
- Q9: Are PDF/email exports required to be tracked or invalidated if MNPI flags appear after distribution?

## 5. User Awareness and Contextual Warnings

**As** a CBCI user  
**I want** visible indicators when an analysis includes MNPI-flagged content  
**So that** I understand the sensitivity of the content I’m working with and can act appropriately.

This includes:
- Pre-analysis warnings for MNPI-flagged deals
- A persistent visual indicator on the analysis page
- Information about why access is blocked, when applicable

**Open Questions:**
- Q10: Should the user interface explain why an analysis is restricted (e.g., “Contains MNPI – access requires clearance”)?
- Q11: Should users be allowed to filter out restricted analyses from their dashboards to reduce confusion?

---

## 6. Auditable Decision Logging and Policy Traceability

**As** an auditor  
**I want** a full record of MNPI access checks, restrictions, reinstatements, and user-level decisions  
**So that** we can demonstrate compliance and investigate issues in regulatory reviews or internal audits.

Logged events should include:
- Access attempts (allowed/denied)
- MNPI flag evaluations at the time of action
- Any reinstatement events tied to flag clearance or user entitlement changes
