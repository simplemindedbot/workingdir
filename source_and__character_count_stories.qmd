# User Story 1: Include Source Count per Analysis in Downstream Report

**Title:** Capture and include the number of sources used in each analysis
**As a** downstream consumer of analysis reports
**I want to** include the number of sources used per analysis
**So that** I can assess the breadth of reference material used by the LLM

## Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Source count is included in downstream JSON report

**Given** an analysis has been generated
**And** the analysis includes a list of referenced sources
**When** the downstream JSON report is generated
**Then** the report must include a `source_count` field for each analysis
**And** the value must reflect the number of distinct sources used
**And** if no sources were used, the value must be `0`

### Scenario: Source count reflects structured metadata

**Given** source data is available from system metadata
**When** the report is built
**Then** the source count must be derived from metadata
**And** must not be inferred from narrative content or manually-entered text

# User Story 2: Include Character Count for Areas of Attention

**Title:** Capture character count for Areas of Attention  
**As a** reviewer or data consumer  
**I want to** see the length of the Areas of Attention section  
**So that** I can monitor consistency, verbosity, and potential red flags in risk analysis content

## Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Character count excludes HTML and includes spaces

**Given** an analysis includes an "Areas of Attention" section  
**When** the downstream report is generated  
**Then** the report must include a field `areas_of_attention_char_count`  
**And** the character count must:
- Include all visible characters, including whitespace  
- Exclude HTML tags, entities, or other formatting code (e.g., `<br>`, `&nbsp;`)

### Scenario: Character count is zero if section is empty

**Given** an analysis has no Areas of Attention  
**When** the report is generated  
**Then** the field `areas_of_attention_char_count` must be present  
**And** its value must be `0`

# User Story 3: Capture Pre- and Post-Edit Character Counts for Financial Analysis

**Title:** Capture Financial Analysis pre- and post-edit character counts  
**As a** compliance or audit stakeholder  
**I want to** capture both the original (pre-edit) and finalized (post-edit) character counts  
**So that** I can evaluate the degree of human intervention and content evolution

## Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Pre-edit character count reflects original LLM output

**Given** an LLM has generated the Financial Analysis section  
**When** the analysis is saved or finalized  
**Then** the report must include a `financial_analysis_char_count_pre_edit` field  
**And** the count must:
- Include spaces  
- Exclude HTML tags and formatting characters  
- Reflect the original text as generated before any user modifications

### Scenario: Post-edit character count reflects finalized user-edited text

**Given** a user has edited the Financial Analysis section  
**And** has clicked "Finalize"  
**When** the report is generated  
**Then** the report must include a `financial_analysis_char_count_post_edit` field  
**And** the count must:
- Include spaces  
- Exclude formatting and HTML  
- Reflect the final text version as accepted by the user

### Scenario: Post-edit matches pre-edit if no changes were made

**Given** the user did not edit the Financial Analysis section  
**And** has finalized the unmodified output  
**When** the report is generated  
**Then** the `financial_analysis_char_count_post_edit` value must equal `financial_analysis_char_count_pre_edit`
