# User Story 1: Include Source Count per Analysis in Downstream Report

**Title:** Capture and include the number of sources used in each analysis
**As a** downstream consumer of analysis reports
**I want to** include the number of sources used per analysis
**So that** I can assess the breadth of reference material used by the LLM

## Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Source count is included in downstream JSON report

**Given** an analysis has been generated
**And** the analysis includes a list of referenced sources
**When** the downstream JSON report is generated
**Then** the report must include a `source_count` field for each analysis
**And** the value must reflect the number of distinct sources used
**And** if no sources were used, the value must be `0`

### Scenario: Source count reflects structured metadata

**Given** source data is available from system metadata
**When** the report is built
**Then** the source count must be derived from metadata
**And** must not be inferred from narrative content or manually-entered text
