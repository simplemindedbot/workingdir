## Context

At 9:07 AM on June 5, 2025, I was contacted by Justin with a request to pull a report from the PFIX environment related to the CBCI project. At that time, I did not have direct access to the PFIX environment.

## Timeline of Actions

| Time (ET)     | Event |
|---------------|-------|
| **9:07 AM**   | Justin requested a PFIX-based report. |
| **9:09 AM**   | I replied to Justin stating I did not currently have PFIX access. |
| **9:10 AM**   | I messaged Jothi to ask about access requirements for PFIX. |
| **9:17 AM**   | I contacted Sharath to ask if he had a PFIX connection string. He shared a connection string using the CBCI service account. *(This exchange will be included.)* |
| **~9:20 AM**  | I used the service account credentials solely to verify connectivity to the PFIX environment. No queries were run or data accessed beyond the basic connection. |
| **9:26 AM**   | I informed the UAT channel that I had PFIX access via the service account, and I notified both Justin and Jothi. |
| **9:30 AM**   | I attempted to connect to PFIX using my own user credentials. The connection succeeded, but I could not view any databases. |
| **9:35 AM**   | Justin advised me not to use the service account and to wait for my user ID to be provisioned. I disconnected immediately and ceased any further access. |
| **9:41 AM**   | I followed up with Jothi to ask how to proceed in getting my ID added with read-only access. He informed me that read-only access was not available in PFIX. |
| **9:44 AM**   | Justin advised me to stand down from the entire PFIX reporting request. No further access was attempted. |
| **9:55 AM**   | Sharath contacted me by phone to let me know that the credential sharing incident had been escalated to Nilesh and Manish within his management chain. |

## Key Points for Clarity

- I did not request credentials; I inquired whether a connection string was available.  
- I used the shared service account credentials only to verify connectivity.  
- I notified Justin and the broader team promptly once access was confirmed.  
- As soon as I was advised not to use the service account, I disconnected and stopped all further activity.  
- I attempted to pursue appropriate access through my own credentials after that.  
- I made no attempt to mask or conceal any part of this process and kept communication open throughout.  

## Going Forward

To prevent any recurrence of confusion or improper access:
- I will not use service accounts or shared credentials unless explicitly approved by both the system owner and my manager.
- Any environment access requests will be routed through the appropriate security provisioning process (e.g., SailPoint or manual ticketing).
- I will clarify and document access boundaries in future cases where I’m uncertain.

Let me know if you want:
	•	A version that renders well in PDF
	•	An embedded appendix with transcript snippets
	•	A more formal incident report version for documentation or HR use

Q1: Would it help to include an appendix for transcripts and Slack/Teams message excerpts?
Q2: Should I draft a standalone summary email to Justin using this as an attachment?
Q3: Do you want a redacted version you can share if asked by others (e.g., Jothi, Sharath)?
